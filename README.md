# React features in vanilla Javascript

## Why?

React is an incredibly popular library, rightfully so since it takes away a lot of pain points.

My goal is to become better in Javascript development, and since I have had some experience with Javascript and React, my teacher Joost thought it would be a good idea to look at a few React features and how I can replicate those in Vanilla Javascript.

It's good to know how things work under the hood after all.
